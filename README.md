# DataLearner - Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery on Android

DataLearner is an open-source easy-to-use tool for data mining and knowledge discovery from your own compatible training datasets. It’s fully self-contained, requires no external storage or network connectivity – it builds machine-learning models directly on your phone or tablet.

DataLearner features classification, association and clustering algorithms from the open-source Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) package, plus new algorithms developed by the Data Science Research Unit (DSRU) at Charles Sturt University. Combined, the app currently provides 40 machine-learning/data-mining algorithms, including RandomForest, C4.5 (J48) and NaiveBayes.

DataLearner collects no information – it requires access to your device storage simply to load your datasets and build your requested models.

Algorithms include:
•	Bayes – BayesNet, NaiveBayes
•	Functions – Logistic, SimpleLogistic
•	Lazy – IBk (K Nearest Neighbours), KStar
•	Meta – AdaBoostM1, Bagging, LogitBoost, MultiBoostAB, Random Committee, RotationForest
•	Rules – Conjunctive Rule, Decision Table, DTNB, JRip, OneR, PART, Ridor, ZeroR
•	Trees – ADTree, BFTree, DecisionStump, ForestPA, J48 (C4.5), LADTree, Random Forest, RandomTree, REPTree, SimpleCART, SPAARC, SysFor.
•	Clusterers – DBSCAN, Expectation Maximisation (EM), Farthest-First, FilteredClusterer, SimpleKMeans
•	Associations – Apriori, FilteredAssociator, FPGrowth

Training datasets must conform to the Weka ARFF or standard CSV file format (CSV requires header row, class attribute is last column and will be configured as nominal).

Pretty simply, really - DataLearner doesn't collect any data. (Google Play collects standard download analytics, but they do that for every app on Google Play. In other words, that's them, not us.)
